# Diwali_Retail_insights
## Project Objective
Python-based EDA project where I analyzed Diwali retail sales. And I Covered data cleaning, grouping, visualization, and deriving insights like top states, age groups, occupations, and product categories contributing to sales.
# DataSet Used
- <a href="https://github.com/RakeshRamagiri13/Diwali_Retail_insights">Data Set

# Main EDA Tasks Perfomed
• Performed complete data cleaning — removed null values, handled missing entries, corrected data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

• Explored customer demographics — analyzed spending patterns by Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, and Occupation.

• Identified top-performing regions — compared State-wise sales and highlighted the top contributing states during Diwali.

• Analyzed product-level performance — evaluated top Product Categories and the amount contribution of each segment.

• Created clear visual insights — used Python plots to uncover trends, distributions, and key business insights for sales improvement

# Process
•	Imported and explored the dataset using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy,Matplotlib And Seaborn) to understand its structure, columns, and initial issues.

•	Cleaned and prepared the data by handling null values, correcting data types, filtering unwanted rows, and ensuring data quality.

•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study customer demographics, sales distribution, and product performance.

•	Created visualizations (bar charts, plots) to identify key insights around age groups, gender, states, occupations, and product categories.

•	Summarized insights and findings that highlight major trends and patterns in Diwali sales, forming the final conclusions of the analysis.

# Project Key Insights
•	Female customers contributed the highest sales, showing stronger purchase activity during the Diwali season compared to male customers.

•	The 25–34 age group showed the highest spending, indicating that young working professionals are the major buyers during the festival period.

•	Top-performing states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh generated the highest revenue, highlighting strong festive market demand in these regions.

•	Product categories like Clothing, Electronics, and Household items dominated the sales, showing that customers prefer gifting and home-improvement products during Diwali.

# Final Conclusion
•	This analysis clearly highlights the key customer groups, top regions, and best-selling product categories that drive Diwali sales. By cleaning the data, performing EDA, and visualizing important patterns, the project provides meaningful insights that can help businesses target the right audience and improve sales strategies during the festive season.
