# Diwali_Retail_insights
## Project Objective
Python-based EDA project where I analyzed Diwali retail sales. And I Covered data cleaning, grouping, visualization, and deriving insights like top states, age groups, occupations, and product categories contributing to sales.
# DataSet Used

# Main EDA Tasks Perfomed
• Performed complete data cleaning — removed null values, handled missing entries, corrected data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

• Explored customer demographics — analyzed spending patterns by Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, and Occupation.

• Identified top-performing regions — compared State-wise sales and highlighted the top contributing states during Diwali.

• Analyzed product-level performance — evaluated top Product Categories and the amount contribution of each segment.

• Created clear visual insights — used Python plots to uncover trends, distributions, and key business insights for sales improvement

# Process
•	Imported and explored the dataset using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy,Matplotlib And Seaborn) to understand its structure, columns, and initial issues.

•	Cleaned and prepared the data by handling null values, correcting data types, filtering unwanted rows, and ensuring data quality.

•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study customer demographics, sales distribution, and product performance.

•	Created visualizations (bar charts, plots) to identify key insights around age groups, gender, states, occupations, and product categories.

•	Summarized insights and findings that highlight major trends and patterns in Diwali sales, forming the final conclusions of the analysis.
